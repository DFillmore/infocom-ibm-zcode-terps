Care and feeding of IBM XZIP

1) Creating the EXE file

   In the ZIP/EZIP world, there is a gamename.COM file.  In the XZIP
   world, it's gamename.EXE, since XZIP can't be put in COM format.  To
   start, copy XZIP.EXE to gamename.EXE.  Then run the MAKEZIP program,
   as follows:
	MAKEZIP gamename.EXE name-of-dat-file game-name copyright-date
   thus:
	MAKEZIP BEYOND.EXE BEYOND.DAT Beyond_Zork 1987
   where any spaces in the actual full game name are replaced by _.

   This will print a message giving the file offset for each string
   added.  It does NOT check any of the arguments for validity, except,
   of course, that the gamename.EXE file has to exist.  The gamename.EXE
   file need not be on the current disk or in the current
   directory--MAKEZIP C:\GAMES\BEYOND.EXE ... would work just fine.

   Note that the datfile name is limited to twelve characters, including
   the .DAT part; the copyright date is limited to four; and the game
   name is limited to the length of "Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or
   Tail of It".

2) Dealing with fonts

   With normal games, the game.ZIP file becomes the game.DAT file
   unmodified.  Games that use funny fonts, like Beyond Zork, must have
   the fonts appended to the dat file before it can be used.  The
   program MAKEDAT does this.  It takes N+1 arguments, where N is the
   number of fonts used by the game:
	MAKEDAT datfile-name I J K ...
   Thus:
	MAKEDAT BEYOND.DAT 3
   The file BEYOND.DAT must exist, and must be fresh--you can only run
   MAKEDAT on it once.  The remaining arguments are the font ids of the
   fonts this game uses.  They must be represented by files FONTn.DAT in
   the connected directory; the font files will be appended to the
   game.DAT file.  If a file is missing, MAKEDAT will complain BEFORE it
   modifies the DAT file, so you're reasonably safe in that case.

   The game.DAT file can be anywhere:  MAKEDAT B:BEYOND.DAT 3 will work
   just fine.  The FONTn.DAT files MUST be on the current disk, in the
   current directory.
